The first week, I had big troubles with installing virtual box and setting up account with feedly, pidgin and twitter.
After Aaron's help, I realized I made a big mistake because I didn't read the instructions carefully enough. Other 
than what the instructions said to change, all other selections should have been default when we creat a new virtual
hard drive. Right now I think I am getting it. I use google search if I have questions and ask friends. I try to use 
ICR through Pidgin, I hope I can see people posting questions and helpful answers. But, as of right now, i have yet to
see that. I was really excited when I made a repo successfully, because the first time I forgot make a director. The
second time I typed the wrong name to commit. The third time, because the wifi problem, I wasted a lot of time to 
figure it out why the file I made wouldn't show up.  All these silly mistakes made me feel more understanding on how to 
use it. I will remind myself to be more careful and not do these silly things again...
So I think my problem is that I hate to read instructions and sometimes I don't understand them, maybe it's because
English is my sacond language, and I'm very bad with computer language. The instructions to me, don't translate into any 
image or language I can understand easily.
After this week, I think I have more confident to use github.
