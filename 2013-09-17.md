Reflections
===========
In last week, we talked about the good things in this class and some things we need to improve it. One thing I really 
want to add to things we need to improve it which is we need feed back about the assignment. For the last reflection, 
I totally forgot it which makes me feel so bad. If we have the assignment feedback, we can make sure we did it and how 
we did it. Although we didn't have the project assignment, we started to communicate with others in group. 
I already installed the virtual box and vagrant to run the python. To make sure I am in the right track, I'd like to 
go the office hour or ask questions in group or GSI. 
For the next week, I think I will have more problems after we start to do project. But I will put more effert and solve 
it.
