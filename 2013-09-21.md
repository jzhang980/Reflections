Reflections
===========
In this week, we had one guest come to present his research about the endangered species Toad. They collabrated 2 
different datas. one is from the past years and one is new data collected by his students during last summer. This
is what we are looking for. Having this data, we need to collabrate and analyze them using diffent methods.  His 
presentation reminded me of my internship last summer. During my internship, we only used a short period time data, so 
we couldn't see very strong relationships. we collabarated data from the past few years, and found the data we wanted. 
Collabarating data was very important and useful . On Thursday, Phillip talked about earthquake prediction. To 
understand more about this topic, I checked out this websit:http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/kids/eqscience.php. It 
helped me understand from the basics. 
I have checked the assignment list already and made sure that I'm ready for the next class.
