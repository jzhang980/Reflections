Reflections
===========
This week, I had problems to install ipython notebook again, I stuggled for a long time at home, but when I tried at school,
it worked and nothing wrong with it. I have no idea about it. Good thing is I don't have any problems about install software
right now. we started our firt project, I think we don't have enough time because Ipython is new for me. I need to learn 
from scratch. what I can do is ask classmates or other friends, but none of them know ipython very well. 
Our group went the office hour today, I learned a lot.
1. The relations between my loptop, virtualbox and virtual machine.
2. How can we read exampl.ipynb file in my ipython notebook.

First, make sure you already installed ipython notebook. 
Second, in VM you need to clone the questionnaire repo: $git clone https://github.com/stat157/questionnaire.git ( in this step, 
you can't just copy and paste the Address, so I typted it)
Third, change the directory to the questionnaire: $ cd questionnaire , list all the files and you can check it:$ls 
Now we have the file example.cfg in our VM, we copy it and change name to stat157 : $cp example.cfg ~/stat157.cfg
Now we have file stat157.cfg in our homedirectory. Change the information in the stat157.cfg file $vi ~/stat157.cfg
Fourth, run ipython notebook $ipython notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0
open your browser, type: http://127.0.0.1:7777/ you should see the example.ipynb file, click it and under the "cell"  click "run all"

3. what is "~" mean in the VM
 ~ means Home directory
