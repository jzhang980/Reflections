Reflections
===========
This week, I had problems to install ipython notebook again, I stuggled for a long time at home, but when I tried at school,
it worked and nothing wrong with it. I have no idea about it. Good thing is I don't have any problems about install software
rightnow. we started our firt project, I think we don't have enough time because Ipython is new for me. I need to learn 
from scratch. what I can do is ask classmate or other friends, but none of them know ipython very well. So I tried to look
up online. I found some website for teaching ipython, I am gonna try it tomorow and I will come back to update.
