Last week, we did our first project. I learned how to use Ipython notebook to do presentation. 
I had lots rodeblocks during this project. 
**One big improvement is learned how to use github markdown.**
1. ##Headers
```###Project```
2.## Emphasis
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
3.##Links
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
4.##Images
Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
5.##Code and Syntax Highlighting
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
