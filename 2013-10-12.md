Last week, we did our first project. I learned how to use Ipython notebook to do presentation. 
I had lots rodeblocks during this project. 
**One big rodeblocks is how to use github markdown.**
1. Headers
```H2Project```
2.###Emphasis
```Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
```
3.H3Links
```[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
```
4.##Images
```Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
```
5.##Code and Syntax Highlighting
```Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

I will come back to fix it.
