Ok, Fix it. Last time, I put code didn't because:
1. when I rename the file, I forgot .md file type. 
2. when I size the words, there are list Numbers in front of it, so it doesn't work. 






# Big
## H2
```javascript
 var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
 alert(s);
 ```
 
 ```python
 s = "Python syntax highlighting"
 print s
 ```
 
 ```
 No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
 But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
 ```
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
