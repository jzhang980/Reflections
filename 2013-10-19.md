I noticed I didn't pull request for all my refections. Also there are only around 11 people
in our class did pull request. So I think we should let otehrs know. 
Steps for turn in week refections.
step1. ##Fork repository http://github.com/Stat157/reflections
step2. ##create a new file ex: 2013-10-19.md  
step3. ##write your reflection then commit it
step4: ## click the icon: compare and review
