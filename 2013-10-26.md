Last week, I have been trouble to get in class on time because the trafic. I spent almost 1 hour to get to school 
and half hour to find a parking place. So I need to get much earlier in order to get class on time. 
For the coming project, I still have questions about it. 
1. what our ultimite goal?
2. Since we have horizontal groups, are we going to do the data curation as group?
3. How we group the vertical groups?

I will go to office hour tomorrow to figure out there questions.
