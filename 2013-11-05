Last week, I learned a lot from office hour. It's very benifical for going to office hour. I consider myself learning 
slow because I hate read a book or instructions. I learn from talking and hand to hand learning. I don't mind spend more 
hours to learn but it is very very slow and unefficient for selflearning. So I am very appriciated Aaron spend so many 
hours on teaching me. Regardless what I can't do, I putted more effort on what I can do and what I could do. Last week, 
I accomplished the following task:

1.Hunting earthquake data, find the elevent papers

2.We wrote a IPython [notebook](https://github.com/stat157/data-curators/blob/master/Harvard%20CMT.ipynb) 
(which also generated a [script](https://github.com/stat157/data-curators/blob/master/Harvard%20CMT.py) ) 
which will download the [gzip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) compressed [ndk-formatted data]
(http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~gcmt/projects/CMT/catalog/allorder.ndk_explained) of 
the [full data set](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~gcmt/projects/CMT/catalog/jan76_dec10.ndk.gz) 
from the [CMT Catalog files page](http://www.globalcmt.org/CMTfiles.html) at http://www.globalcmt.org/

3.I did do the same for the SCEC data: http://www.one-tab.com/page/EBoWiHe1TF-kOU1G1knTBg
 (as shared with http://www.one-tab.com/) which is in a gzip-compressed 
 [tarball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)
