Last week, I learned a lot from office hour. It's very benifical for going to office hour. I consider myself learning 
slow because I hate read a book or instructions. I learn from talking and hand to hand learning. I don't mind spend more 
hours to learn but it is very very slow and unefficient for selflearning. So I am very appriciated Aaron spend so many 
hours on teaching me. Regardless what I can't do, I putted more effort on what I can do and what I could do. Last week, 
I accomplished the following task:

1.Hunting earthquake data, find the elevent papers

2.We wrote a IPython notebook (which also generated a script ) which will download the gzip compressed ndk-formatted 
data of the full data set from the CMT Catalog files page at http://www.globalcmt.org/

3.I did do do the same for the SCEC data: http://www.one-tab.com/page/EBoWiHe1TF-kOU1G1knTBg 
(as shared with http://www.one-tab.com/) which is in a gzip-compressed tarball


Roadblocks:

1. Once I open an Ipython notebook under dirctor A, always goes that dirctor even if I want to open another 
Ipython notebook under other dirctor. **Easiest way**: turn off the virtual machine than turn it on again. 

2. How can I get the update github repo?
   command **git pull**
   
3. After I make a new ipython note book, How can I git push to github?
  ...git add XX.ipynb
  ...git commit -m 'add XX notebook'
  ...git confit --global user.email ".....@gmail.com"
  ...git config --global user.name "XXXX"
  ...git status
  ...git push
  
4.Also I learned a lots keyboard shotcuts:
 
  ...Ctrl+c ----cancel program
  ...Ctrl+z ----stop program
  ...jobs   ----list jobs in shell (check running and stop program)
  ...fg/bg  ----sent program to front or back
  ...Alt+Tab----shell comes up
  ...Shit+Tab---remove indentation
  ...Ctrl+Enter-run cell
  ...Ctrl+s ---save
