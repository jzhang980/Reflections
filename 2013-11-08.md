This week, I got seriously cold. I didn't learn much after class. But during class, I saw other classmates they did 
very good jobs. Someone started form the class stucture for the last few week this semester. This is awesome idea which 
I had it too. But they putted effort on it make this idea become the truth. I think my biggest roadblock is my english. I
Anyway, I can't improve my English in short periid of time. But I think I am going to make my SMART goal for the rest of 
this semester. Gradually to complish my own goal for this class.
