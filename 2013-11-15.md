Weekly Reflection
---

Up until now, our curator groups basically finished our tasks. We provited anaylers clean data from SCEC with 
the right format they asked. We supported them through Email and github. From this week, We were also assigned to 
other groups to help.  
Alisha and I will join to vertualizer group and group members are:
**‚ù§** ( [Repository]() & [S.M.A.R.T Goals]() )

 - **Hong SHON**               ( [tzenarr](https://github.com/tzenarr) )
    - Hyung Kyu CHANG         ( [hkchang89](https://github.com/hkchang89) )
    - Sunghoon CHOI           ( [shchoi](https://github.com/schoi) )
    - Christina HO            ( [chocoho](https://github.com/chocoho) )
    - Jinsoo LEE              ( [annyeongjs](https://github.com/annyeongjs) )

Also we will have have a meeting on this Saturday. We will make our SMART goal during the meeting. We already met on 
thursday lecture, only 4 group members including Alisha and I. So I think we will have lots roadblocks later. None of 
us have strong background with coding, ipyton,etc. They haven't done much, but I think we will make our SMART goal and 
accomplish it. First, I think I can help them undertand how to use github and know how to do the basic tasks whcih we
have been doing. I think this class, one of the important things is communicaton. This class has no peer competition
presure, classmates include myself are very happy and willing to help others.
