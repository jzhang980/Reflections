This week, our visualheart group set our SMART goal for this week and next week. Our group improved communication with 
each other by email, github and facebook. Each one has small task for each week which is more functional and efficent. 
I tried to run the code from the Quakers group. I had lots roadblocks during the task becasue they use R. First, I wrote 
the Roadblock on the group github. Second, Alisha  followed my steps and run the code, then wrote what we should improve 
and help me to slove my problems. Third, Qi modified the R code and improved the graphs.

I can't make office hour this weekend becasue my car tire flated. Alisha will tell me what's my task after they figure 
out after office hour. 

For next week, I think I will support our group as usual. Follow our SMART groul, finish our task on time.
