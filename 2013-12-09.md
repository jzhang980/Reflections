look back this semester,  I have been through confusion, frustrated, motivated, sadness and happyness. 
I think I improved my communication skills and self-learning skills. I noticed science reproducibility is very important
and also a major area scientist will be focused on. I learned github is very useful for scientist communicating. This is 
my first time I wish I can be a real scientist. Although I didn't do lot about coding, I have interested in it and wish 
one day I can be a real technical engineer. Ipython notebook is very powerful and useful for science presentation. I will
learn more other computer language from now on.
