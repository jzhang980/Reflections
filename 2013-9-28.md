Reflections
===========
This week, before I went to class tuesday, I was really confident because I had all the tools on my computer
and I thought I was ready to go. But something just happened unexpected, I don't known what happened,
I can't login my vertual machine. I was pretty sure my login and password were correct because I wrote down in my notes
and I successfully login last week. This is really crush me down. I asked GSI, he suggested me to start it over again. 
Oh my! Since I already did once, It's not difficult do to it again, which makes me feel the point we try to make in this 
class which is learning is the process of solving problems. On thursday class, GIS and professor tried to explain what and 
why we did in past 3 weeks. I understood some student thought our class may goes too slow and they couldn't wait to do 
project any more. But this is the collabrated data science class, it requires more cooperation, so I am really preciate 
professor try to keep all students on the same page before we do project. Right now, I fixed all the problems and I am ready
to do the next step.
